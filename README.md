This project, completed during a data science course, uses Pandas for CSV reading, NumPy for data arrays and missing value handling, and scikit-learn for a Linear Regression model, including train-test data splitting. It predicts Salesprice (dependent) based on Baseprice (independent) using Y=MX+C.
After training the model, accuracy and predictions are evaluated. For one dependent and one/multiple independent variables, Linear or MultiLinear Regression is applied. Matplotlib visualizes the ideal straight line for comparison with the actual data.
