# predictiveanalysis

This project completed during training(data science course).

In this project i used pandas for csv reading, numpy for data array and missing value handling, sklearn for LINEAR REGRESSION model as well as train data and test data spliting.

we can also check the accuracy of the model.

First of all enter sales data which have two columns=Baseprice and Salesprice. IN Y=MX+C y=dependent variable which is salesprice and x=independent variable which is baseprice.
Split data into train data and test data. Fit train data into model and run the model then test the model by accuracy and by predicting test data. After that we can randomly choose baseprice and according that baseprice we can predict salesprice.

dependent column will be only one and independent column will be one=Linear Regression

dependent column will be only one but independent column will be one or more than one=MultiLinear Regression

Matplotlib library used for visualisation of ideal straight line for comparison to the actual line.
